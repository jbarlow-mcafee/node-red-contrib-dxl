The Node-RED OpenDXL contribution package includes JSON documents with sample
Node-RED flows. To import samples into Node-RED, perform the following steps:

1. In the upper-right corner of the Node-RED UI, press the side menu button.

1. Select one of examples under
   `Import → Examples → dxl` in the menu drop-down list.

In order for the sample flows to execute properly, Node-RED must be able to
connect to a DXL fabric. For more information on connecting to a DXL fabric
from Node-RED, see the {@tutorial configuration} section.
